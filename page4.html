       <h3 class="white">What would it look like from the outside?</h3>
    <p>If you were to watch someone fall into a black hole, not only would they get pulled into a black hole, but the light they emit would also be sucked in. So when watching someone fall into a black hole, as they move closer, their movement would get slower until they reach the event horizon. When the person reaches the event horizon they would stop and they would slowly fade out, glowing slightly reddish, basically you would never see someone cross the event horizon of a black hole.</p>
    <h3 class="white">What would it look like from the inside?</h3>
    <p>As you fall into a black hole, your range of view of the universe would slowly get compressed into a smaller and smaller unit behind you until everything is pitch black. </p>
    <h3 class="white">What happens if you fall into a black hole?</h3>
    <p>When falling into a black hole, you would be literally stretched towards the singularity, in a process called "spaghettification", then idealy, your atoms and particles would be violently torn apart as you reach the singularity. However this idea has not been confirmed, scientist also suppose that a black hole could be a "gate" to parallel universes through a "wormhole". When you are in a wormhole, you don't actually teleport to a location, but that location basically teleports to you, or moves to you.</p>
