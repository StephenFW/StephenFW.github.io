    <h2 class="cw">How do black holes form?</h2>
    <p>A black hole forms when a certain volume is compressed into an extreme amount of pressure. When an object is compressed, it will become a black hole when it is compressed smaller than a certain unit. This unit is called the "Schwarzchild Radius", where basically if anything no matter what size or mass is compressed into its Schwarzchild Radius it will become a black hole. </p>
    <p>A black hole usually forms when a star reaches the end of its life and collapses in on itself. When a star collapses into the Schwarzchild radius, it will become a black hole.<img src="http://www.westcoastplacer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/supernova-25884-1366x768.jpg"></p>
    <p class="fss">As a star collapses, its pressure and mass is so great that if a star is big enough, it may collapse into a black hole instead of exploding into a supernova.</p>

      <li class="white">For regular stars.
        <ol>
        <li class="white">A star is formed through the processes that take place in a stellar nebula.</li>
        <li class="white">Over time, the star gets larger and larger and becomes a "red giant".</li>
        <li class="white">The red giant bursts into a planetary nebula that creates heavier elements that would not have been created with fusion.</li>
        <li class="white">A white dwarf remains after the star has collapsed within its own gravitational force.</li>

      <li class="white">For massive stars.
        <ol>
          <li class="white">A massive star is formed through the processes that take place in a stellar nebula.</li>
          <li class="white">Over time, the star gets larger and larger and becomes a "red supergiant".</li>
          <li class="white">The red supergiant explodes in a supernova.</li>
          <li class="white">Either a black hole or a neutron star forms after the supernova due to the star collapsing by its own gravity.</li>
