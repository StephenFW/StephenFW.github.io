    <h3 class="cw">What is a black hole?</h3>
    <p>A black hole can't really be considered a physical object, nor can it be cut, moved, or altered in any way that can be done to any physical item. There isn't exactly a clear picture of what a black hole looks like but the best description could be that a black hole is merely a "hole" in the fabric of space. Thus giving it the name "black hole". <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/BH_LMC.png/220px-BH_LMC.png"></p>
    <p>The fabric of space is a non-corporeal representation of how mass and gravity works, planets, stars, meteors, comets, and even light travels on the fabric of space. Imagine putting a bowling ball on a large piece of fabric with nothing underneath it. The bowling ball creates a dent on the fabric and this represents its gravitational pull, everything near by will fall into this "dent" in the space time fabric until it makes contact with the object at its center. Now imagine that there isn't an object at the center of the dent and the "dent" simply is a hole in the fabric, objects nearby will fall into the hole but they wont make contact with anything in the center and they will simply fall into the hole, never to be seen again.</p>
